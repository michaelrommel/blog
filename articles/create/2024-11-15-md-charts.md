# How to embed Svelte in Markdown

## Motivation

Originally I started the design of this blog with `mdsvx` bur later 
ran into issues with the compatibility with various other plugins for `remark`
and `rehype` and therefore I stripped out all non-essential features and
stuck to rendering plain Markdown.

Later this year, I needed to have a charts integration, so I decided to do
some kind of barebones integration myself. It could look like this:

::svelte[]{ componentname="BarChart" data="inline" xSelector="year"}

This is achieved by using a very simple MarkDown directive, that spells out
the componentname and some properties. Let's look at it in more detail.


## Design

A typical rendering stack for Markdown involves in Javascript the use of a
chain of `remark` plugins, followed by another chain of `rehype` plugins.
Those plugins perform specialized tasks, that you may or may not need for
your site, like the parsing of YAML frontmatter or processing :grin:
emojis.

The module I used here is `remarkDirective` which allows you to use the
defined Markdown Directives, like `:`, `::` or `:::`. Those are
`textdirective`, `leafdirective` or `containerdirectives`. They can be used
to transform Markdown into non-standard HTML tags, that you can process in
later steps.

In my case I decided to keep things very simple and use something like
this:

```md
::svelte[]{ componentname="BarChart" data="inline" xSelector="year"}
```

In a first step, the Markdown directive is translated into a
`<SvelteComponent></SvelteComponent>` tag with this code:

```js
function remarkDirectiveHandler() {
	// console.log('In myRemarkPlugin');
	const directiveNames = ['note', 'svelte', 'comment', 'img', 'div'];
	return (tree) => {
		visit(tree, (node) => {
			// console.log(node);
			if (
				// textDirective is :name[content]{attribute}
				node.type === 'textDirective' ||
				// leafdirective is ::name[content]{attributes}
				node.type === 'leafDirective' ||
				// containerDirective is :::name\ncontent\n:::
				node.type === 'containerDirective'
			) {
				if (!directiveNames.includes(node.name)) return;

				const data = node.data || (node.data = {});
				let attributes = node.attributes || {};
				let tagName = node.type === 'textDirective' ? 'span' : 'div';

				// special treatment for svelte components
				if (node.name === 'svelte') {
					tagName = 'SvelteComponent';
				}
				data.hName = tagName;
				data.hProperties = h(tagName, attributes).properties;
			}
		});
	};
}
```

So this post looks like this after the first step of the transformation:

```html
It could look like this:</p>\n
<SvelteComponent componentname=\"BarChart\" data=\"inline\" xSelector=\"year\">
</SvelteComponent>\n<p>This is achiev...
```

In the second step the rendered html is split around this special tag and
the tag's attributes are converted into a js object. It looks then like
this:

```js
[
  "<h1>How to embed Svelt ... It could look like this:</p>\n",
  {
    "componentname": "BarChart",
    "data": "inline",
    "props": {
      "xSelector": "year"
    }
  },
  "\n<p>This is achiev..."
]
```

Then the trick is to instantiate a Svelte Component in place, where the
`<SvelteComponent>` was before. I derived this idea from an example I found
in Svelte's Playgrounds 
[here](https://svelte.dev/playground/f54e07cfccef4f9aa92de0bc39769aa2).

```html
{#await injectComponents(data) then splitted}
	{#each splitted as part}
		{@const match = typeof part === "object"}
		{#if match}
			{#if data}
				<svelte:component
					this={components[part.componentname]}
					data={data.chartdata[part.data]}
					{...part.props}
				></svelte:component>
			{:else}
				<svelte:component
					this={components[part.componentname]}
					{...part.props}
				></svelte:component>
			{/if}
		{:else}
			<!-- eslint-disable-next-line svelte/no-at-html-tags -->
			{@html part}
		{/if}
	{/each}
{/await}
```

Based on the information from Markdown, this puts a svelte component right
at this place and its props define then the data to render and the rest of
the props that each component needs.

Another example is embedding a viewer for an STL or GLTF file, to showcase
the 3D models I made:

::svelte[]{ componentname="StlViewer" file="example2.stl" dpr=true inertia=1200}

This will display a WebGL Renderer right above this place. You can
dynamically change the intensity of the spotlights and also control the
amount of time, the model continues to rotate after you give it a spin and
release the mouse button.

Expect to see more 3D related content in the next posts.

I hope this inspires you to also experiment a little bit with markdown and
its extensions.
