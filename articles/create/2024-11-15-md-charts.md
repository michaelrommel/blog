# How to embed Svelte in Markdown

## Motivation

I had issues with the compatibility of `mdsvx` with various other plugins for `remark`
and `rehype` so therefore I stripped out all non-essential features and

Later this year, I needed to have a charts integration, so I decided to do
some kind of barebones integration myself. It could look like this:

::svelte[]{ componentname="BarChart" data="inline" xSelector="year"}

This is achieved by using a very simple MarkDown directive, that spells out
the componentname and some properties. Let's look at it in more detail.
