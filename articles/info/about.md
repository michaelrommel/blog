Germany.

I am an engineer at heart. My first education after school was as an
industrial clerk, but I soon discovered that this was not my calling. I
finished the training, but went on to study electical engineering, focusing
on microelectronics, network and communications. I have stayed in this
broad field ever since and am still passionate about it.

My spare time interests are pretty diverse: photography, design,
typography, sports, but most of all -- creating things. Whether it is a piece
of furniture, some software or a drawing is not as important as the
process. Learning new things is an important part of my lifestyle. I am
intrigued by advances in technology or simply understanding the mechanics of
what mankind has created so far. I often lose myself in a new topic, getting to
the bottom of its inner workings and start way too many projects, instead of
finishing them -- probably because once I have solved the main problem, the
execution of it always seems a bit boring afterwards.

This webpage serves as a knowledge base and idea sharing place for me.
Maybe it inspires someone else to create something new or helps someone to
solve a problem.

Have a good time and feel free to comment on the articles on Github.
